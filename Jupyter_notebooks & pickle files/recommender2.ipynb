       "  255: '先声明本游戏战斗有一定难度，并不适合喜欢玩挂机刷刷刷的朋友。 由于并没有太多的测试人员，主要是我自己在测试，即便我玩了很多遍，但难免会有遗漏和不合理的地方。 如果有出现bug或者大家觉得有某些地方难度不合理，希望大家能积极反馈，评论区留言或者进群@都行！感谢各位赏脸游玩！ 游戏着有不同于其他回合制游戏的战斗机制，每个角色有着独特且能产生质变的天赋加点，你可以把角色按你想的方向上培养。 但是注意你的天赋需要与你主要使用的技能搭配，才能发挥最大效果。 本游戏需要注意的点： 1.很多技能释放需要tp点，我们可以通过加攻速或者加tp回复来提高tp获取效率。 2.技能每次使用会获得熟练度，熟练度可以提升技能等级和伤害，技能熟练度达到要求会解锁更高级技能，所以我们要尽可能多的使用技能，把一个技能练到极致会比每个技能练一会要强得多！ 3.游戏的里控制技能对任何敌人都有效，但部分怪物被控制后会狂暴，狂暴状态下将免疫控制且伤害可能会略微提高。 4.按q可以快捷保存。 5.设置里面有设置战斗加速，修改窗口样式等功能。 6.更换装备时镶嵌物品会自动转移到新装备上，不需要自己取下来重新镶嵌。 关于战斗： 与其他回合制战斗不同，游戏中有攻速属性。 攻速直接影响角色普通攻击造成伤害的次数，而普通攻击每次造成伤害恢复5点tp，物理系技能是没有冷却时间的只受tp点数的限制，所以攻速也间接的影响了技能的释放频率。 对于敏捷路线的角色，想要提升输出，提升敏捷和攻速是最佳方式。（前提是你的攻击不能太低） 对于力量和智力路线的角色，攻速带来的提升并不明显，所以tp恢复至关重要。很多时候直接增加伤害不如增加tp恢复来的实在！ 关于美术： 刚开始是有想请画师和美工的打算，可是了解了下价格我放弃了…… 整个游戏包括角色立绘、行走图、怪物图片、场景图块、技能特效、ui设计然后一堆图标感觉没个十来万下不来，这让我实在承受不住。 后来想找人已合作的方式给分成，但似乎也不现实，毕竟想找人来免费玩你的游戏都挺困难的…… 所以，只能咬咬牙自己瞎折腾了。游戏的ui素材大部分是rpg make和dlc自带的，也使用了部分其他资源，费劲力气也只能整成现在这样了！ 关于剧情： 作为一个rpg游戏剧情至关重要，但是很遗憾…… 我个人觉得游戏的剧情框架还是不错的，但是受限于自己的文笔和图片素材不足，很多剧情其实都是根据现有图片素材临时编的。 其实游戏中有很多东西没有讲，比如： 1.关于水斗的来历，其实佐克和水斗的父母其实曾经也是猎魔者，后来水斗父母意外死亡，于是佐克退隐照顾主角。 2.夜瞳的父亲其实是十几年前的被星玄打败的将军，整个军队全部战死无一生还。由于莫名其妙的被人团灭，他从受人尊敬的将军变成笑柄，夜瞳和母亲也饱受其他人的嘲笑，夜瞳的母亲也因此郁郁而终，所以长大后夜瞳来到帕拉斯是想弄清楚当年的事，为父亲正名。 3.乌诺斯为啥要打帕拉斯？其实是有人拱火，这个人和故事的幕后黑手麦迪文一样其实都来自的另一个大陆。他们就是想两边拱火，让两国打起来，他们就可以乘机进行实验，制造战斗用的魔物，说白了就是想把这片大陆当成战争实验室。 4.其实后续还有剧情，大致内容是：两国还是打起来了，之后再与夜瞳再见面，却不得不兵戎相见。然后会有新角色出现，阻止了战斗，新角色是另一个大陆的人，他正在调查他们那个大陆的一个邪恶组织，而这场战争就是这个邪恶组织在幕后操纵，目的是乘乱制造出可控制的魔物…… 其实整个剧情有点参考了一部日本动漫《大剑》，这是一部被禁的神作（个人觉得是神作！），至今我的电脑里还有这部动漫的资源，想看的可以加群@我，哈哈哈…… 后续： 虽然这个游戏还有后续剧情，但是暂时不打算出续作，因为我觉得自己目前还没有力能把剩下的故事讲好…… 也许等哪一天时机成熟了，我会回来继续填这个坑，也许…… 之后还是会接着做新的游戏，目前有一些思路，大致是一个策略经营+战棋的游戏。 新游戏的话打算用unity去做，也会花钱去请美工画师，有新进度我也会在群里通知大家，希望大家到时能关注一下。 游戏qq群：634019932 作者b站主页： 头条和西瓜视频： adventur free to play indi rpg',\n",
